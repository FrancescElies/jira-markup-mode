Jira Markup Mode
================

Jira Markup Mode provides syntax highlighting and editing features for
the markup used by [Atlassian JIRA][jira] in a similar fashion as
[markdown-mode][mdmode] for Markdown syntax.

Jira Markup Mode does not interact with the JIRA issue tracker in any
way. It is not meant as a replacement for `[jira.el][jirael]`.

Use cases that come to mind:

* Edit files in [Confluence][confl] markup for a Maven site.
  Confluence markup is the same as the one used in JIRA.  There is a
  Doxia site renderer for Confluence markup, so it is possible to use
  Confluence to create pages for your Maven site instead of the
  cumbersome APT markup.

* Edit the contents for browser text fields in your favourite editor
  (aka Emacs) instead of inside the browser.  It is a pain to write
  and edit longer texts such as issue descriptions and comments
  directly in the browser.  Luckily here is a Firefox add-on to the
  rescue: [It's All Text!][atxt].  It allows you to open the content
  of a browser text field in an external editor and after leaving the
  editor insert the updated text back into the original text field.
